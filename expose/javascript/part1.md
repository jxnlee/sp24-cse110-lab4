1. the code prints 'values added:  20' to the console
2. the code prints 'final result:  20' to the console
3. the code prints 'values added:  20' to the console
4. the code returns an error: this is because `let` provides the `result` variable with only a block scope, and since the variable is instantiated in the if code block and line 13 prints to console outside of the code block, it appears at that line of code that the `result` variable has not yet been defined.
5. The code returns an error: this is because `const` prevents the variable `result` from being reassigned. since `const result = 0` declares the constant variable `result` as 0, the next line which reassigns `result` to `num1 + num2` produces the error since the reassigment of constants is not allowed.
